## Final Submission

### Overview

The overview should be at least a paragraph and describe what your project is about.

### Tutorial

The tutorial should at least be 2 paragraphs long and describe how to get started using the program. For example, if it
is a game then you might want to introduce how to start playing and what the basic controls are. If it is a web
application, you might want to indicate how to navigate the application and interact with different components.

### Installation Instructions

Write instructions here for running your program and any files required to do so as appropriate for your programming
language**. For Python projects, this typically means having a `requirements.txt file` that you create using
“pip freeze > requirements.txt”.

### Citation, Sources, and References

Complete this section to include citations for assets and resources that you used for your project. For example, you could
write this section like in the following example:

```
UI-Pack Sci-FI: https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack-sci-fi

Digital Audio Pack: https://kenney.nl/assets/digital-audio

I created by own ASCII art using https://asciiflow.com/#/ and generative AI.
```

Any assets and resources you use need to be verifiable that they are licenced for you to use. If you made your
own assets or used generative AI, you must indicate that you did so. Include a link to any assets that you
downloaded and used. **Leaving this section unedited will count as not having completed it.**
