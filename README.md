# Project - [Legacy of the Occult]

This repository is for the semester project. For each milestone, you should update the corresponding
section with information about your project status. 

## Milestone 1

Update this section to describe your project for milestone 1 and complete the following sections. If your project is
using assets, be sure to keep the citations, sources, and resources section updated.

### Current Progress

For Milestone 1, I have setup a basic grid system for an isometric game. Additionally, I have 8-directional movement controls
for the main player character along with a camera that follows the player's movements. I have accomodated for WASD and arrow
keys.

### Challenges

One major challenge was realizing that the coordinate system for Godot is not the same as a normal coordinate system typically
found in most math classes. Rather than the positive y-axis pointing up, the positive y-axis points down, which had a major affect
on the implementation of my movement controls.

### Future Directions

Currently, I have plans to implement a building system. Each building will take a certain amount of resources and have different
roles and benefits. I also want to add the ability to recruit other characters to help with the creation of your village.

### Instructions

I have included a web build for Milestone 1 so people can test out the movement controls. In future milestones, I'm planning one
hosting this on GitHub pages, but for now this feature can be run locally on your computer.

## Final Submission

### Overview

The overview should be at least a paragraph and describe what your project is about.

### Tutorial

The tutorial should at least be 2 paragraphs long and describe how to get started using the program. For example, if it
is a game then you might want to introduce how to start playing and what the basic controls are. If it is a web
application, you might want to indicate how to navigate the application and interact with different components.

### Installation Instructions

Write instructions here for running your program and any files required to do so as appropriate for your programming
language**. For Python projects, this typically means having a `requirements.txt file` that you create using
“pip freeze > requirements.txt”.

### Citation, Sources, and References

Complete this section to include citations for assets and resources that you used for your project. For example, you could
write this section like in the following example:

```
UI-Pack Sci-FI: https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack-sci-fi

Digital Audio Pack: https://kenney.nl/assets/digital-audio

I created by own ASCII art using https://asciiflow.com/#/ and generative AI.
```

Any assets and resources you use need to be verifiable that they are licenced for you to use. If you made your
own assets or used generative AI, you must indicate that you did so. Include a link to any assets that you
downloaded and used. **Leaving this section unedited will count as not having completed it.**
